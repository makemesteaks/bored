## You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.
##Let's look at a few examples:
##- array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 32 == 9;
##- array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.
##Input: Two arguments. An array as a list of integers and a number as a integer.
##Output: The result as an integer.
##Precondition: 0 < len(array) ≤ 10
##0 ≤ N
##all(0 ≤ x ≤ 100 for x in array)


def index_power(array, n):
    if n >= len(array):
        return -1
    else:
        return array[n] ** n
